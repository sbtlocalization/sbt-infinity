# SBT Infinity Tools

[☑️ Українська](./README.md) | **✅ English**

Here you can find our auxiliary tools for working with Infinity Engine-based games, such as Baldur’s Gate, Baldur’s Gate II, Planescape: Torment, and others.

## Building the Project

```
go build
```

## License

Without open source contributions from many people, localizing games would be much harder if possible at all. By releasing the code of our small tool, we want to give something back to the community and hope it will be useful to someone.

So, all code in this repository is available under the [GPL 3.0](./LICENSES/GPL-3.0-only.txt) license, and all graphic assets (except original game resources) are licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>&nbsp;<img src="https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/cc.svg" alt="" width="16px" height="16px"><img src="https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/by.svg" alt="" width="16px" height="16px"><img src="https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/sa.svg" alt="" width="16px" height="16px">
